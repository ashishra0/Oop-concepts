# Object Oriented Programming

Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and their interactions to design and program applications

- Allows the programming to block of areas of code that perform certain tasks independently of other areas in the application.

- <b> Encapsulation </b> - concept of blocking off areas of code and not making it available to the rest of the program.

- <b> Abstraction </b> is simplifying a complex process of a program, an enterprise software solution for example by modeling classes appropriate for it.

- <b> Inheritance </b> is used where a class inherits the behavior of another class, refereed to as the superclass. 

- <b> Polymorphism </b> is when a class inherits the behaviours of another class, but has the ability to not inherit everything and change some of it's inherited behaviors. For example: to write a method that does something differently from the inherited method.

- Classes - It is a blueprint that describes the state and behavior that the objects of te class all share. A class can be used to create many objects. Objects created at runtime from a class are called instances of that particular class.
